4. The code returns an error on line 13. 
   >ReferenceError: result is not defined

   It is a reference error because `let` keyword in this funsction `sumValues()` can only be accessed within the `if` statement block. However, line 13 calls the `let` keyword - `result` - outside the `if` statement, so the code returns an error.
5. The code returns a type error.
   >TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

    This is because `const` keyword prevents being reassigned after it is intially assigned. Line 7 attempts to reassign the `const` keyword `result`, thus causes an error.
